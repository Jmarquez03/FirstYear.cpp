# FirstYear.cpp
First Year Projects (primarily C++)
  Although this is my Sophomore year of College, I titled the repository as "First Year" since this is my first year working in C++ as well as my first year
  truly programming. Although I did take a course in Computer Science in my previous College, it was only 3 1/2 weeks long and in Java. I do not deem that enough time to
  consider it as a whole year of programming.
